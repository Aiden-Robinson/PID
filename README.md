# PID Robotics Project

This repository contains Arduino-based projects focused on robotics control systems, particularly using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) algorithms. The code is designed for experimentation and learning in the field of robotics, with a focus on ball control, sensor integration, and actuator testing.

## Project Structure

- **ball_control/**: Implements basic ball control using PID algorithms.
- **ball_control_kalman/**: Enhances ball control with Kalman filtering for improved sensor fusion and noise reduction.
- **servo_motor_test/**: Simple tests for servo motor control and calibration.
- **ultrasonic_sensor_test/**: Experiments with ultrasonic distance sensors for object detection and measurement.

## Features

- PID control for precise movement and stabilization
- Sensor integration (ultrasonic, etc.)
- Kalman filtering for sensor data smoothing
- Modular code for easy experimentation

## Getting Started

1. Open the desired `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE or VS Code with the Arduino extension.
2. Connect your Arduino-compatible board.
3. Upload the code to your board.
4. Follow any specific instructions in the code comments for hardware setup.

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE or VS Code with Arduino extension
- Arduino-compatible microcontroller (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Relevant hardware (servos, ultrasonic sensors, etc.)

## License

This project is for personal and educational use. Feel free to use or modify the code for your own experiments.
